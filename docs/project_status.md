## Editor Club — Social Features (2026-09-10) ✅

### Feed
- [x] Smart feed algorithm: `{enrouted, recommended}` buckets
  - Enrouted = videos from followed creators, ordered by recency
  - Recommended = all others, ordered by `creator.credits DESC, created_at DESC`
- [x] Section dividers in feed (`Following` / `Recommended`)
- [x] Swipe navigation: drag up/down on the reel card (mouse + touch); tap to pause
- [x] Arrow keys still work alongside swipe
- [x] S3 presigned URLs for in-browser video streaming

### Upload
- [x] Format toggle: **Scene** (landscape 16:9) vs **Shot** (portrait 9:16)
- [x] Drop zone shape matches selected format aspect ratio
- [x] Moderation result shown inline after upload (pillar score bars + reasons)

### Credits
- [x] `users.credits` integer column (incremented per-video by any viewer)
- [x] `POST /videos/{id}/credit` endpoint
- [x] Star button in feed with live count display

### Follow / Enroute
- [x] `follows` table: `(follower_id, following_id)` primary key
- [x] `POST /creators/{id}/follow` and `DELETE /creators/{id}/follow`
- [x] Enroute/Deroute button in feed overlay (creator info bar)
- [x] Enroute/Deroute button on creator profile page
- [x] Enroute/Deroute button in search results

### Comments
- [x] `comments` table: `(id, video_id, user_id, body, created_at)`
- [x] `GET /videos/{id}/comments` and `POST /videos/{id}/comments`
- [x] Comment drawer in feed: fetches on open, posts with author attribution
- [x] Author name + initials shown per comment

### Search
- [x] `GET /search?q=` — ILIKE across creator names, departments, video filenames
- [x] Debounced search (400ms) via `useEffect` + `useRef` timer
- [x] Error state (API unreachable), no-results state, animated loading dots
- [x] Clear button (×) in search input
- [x] Creator results: clickable name → profile, Enroute/Deroute button
- [x] Video results: filename, creator, moderation status chip

### Creator Profile
- [x] `/creators/[id]` page: avatar (initials), name, department, CREATOR chip
- [x] Stat tiles: follower count, video count, credits
- [x] Enroute/Deroute with optimistic update + revert on error
- [x] Back button

### NavBar / Branding
- [x] Logo: "EC" collapsed → "Editor Club" expanded (with home link)
- [x] Nav items: Home (`/feed`), Search (`/search`), Upload (`/upload`, creator only)
- [x] Profile pinned to bottom slot; logout only on `/profile`

### Bug Fixes
- [x] Same-origin proxy (`next.config.ts`) eliminates mixed-content HTTPS→HTTP block
- [x] `isDivider(undefined)` crash at Next.js build time fixed (null guard)
- [x] `videos.user_id::uuid` JOIN cast fixed (EC2 schema has UUID type, not TEXT)
- [x] `_CREATE_COMMENTS_TABLE` split into two separate `execute()` calls (psycopg2 single-statement limit)

### Repo Health Tooling
- [x] `scripts/scan-repo.py`: 6-check scanner (secrets, dead code, .env drift, stale docs, TODOs)
- [x] `.git/hooks/pre-commit`: auto-runs scanner before every commit; blocks on critical issues, warns on non-blocking ones; Windows-compatible (shell script, not Python shebang)

### CI/CD: PR Review Bot & Test Infrastructure (2026-09-10)
- [x] `tests/test_decision_engine.py`: 14 unit tests, pure-logic (no DB) — every threshold branch covered
- [x] `frontend/lib/auth.test.ts`: 5 Vitest tests for auth localStorage helpers
- [x] `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` — both 100% clean, zero baseline exceptions
- [x] `.github/workflows/pr-review-bot.yml`: lint-typecheck + artifact-scan + regression-tests → auto-merge on all-green
- [x] `.github/workflows/update-baseline.yml`: refreshes `.ci/baseline-results.json` after every merge to `main`
- [x] `scripts/verify_artifacts.py`: validates Next.js build output against its own routes manifest
- [x] `scripts/compare_baseline.py` + `generate_baseline.py`: JUnit-based regression diffing
- [x] `scripts/review_bot.py`: decision logic — merges only if every required job is exactly `success`
- [x] `scripts/spawn-agent-worktree.sh`: isolated git worktree + branch per agent/task, own npm/pip install
- [x] `scripts/setup_branch_protection.sh` applied to the live repo — `main` now requires the 3 PR-bot status checks before merge; direct `git push` to `main` is rejected (`GH006: Protected branch update failed`), confirmed firsthand during doc updates on 2026-09-22. All work since lands via PR + auto-merge.
- [x] `BOT_PAT` repo secret configured (2026-09-11) — decision job can now comment/merge PRs

## Messenger Channel Fixes (2026-09-19 – 2026-09-21) ✅
- [x] Nav restructure: removed the New Message / Requests / Conversations tab bar; `/messages` redirects to `/messages/conversations` (default landing page), which gains a New Requests link with pending count and a New message button. Compose/search moved to `/messages/compose`.
- [x] `nav-bar.tsx` Messages-link fallback (requests vs. conversations by badge state) re-scoped to the Messages item only — a prior version applied it to every nav item's `href`, which silently made Home/Search no-op while already on a `/messages/*` page (found and fixed via scripted browser repro, PR #27)
- [x] Per-message timestamps and day separators in the thread view (`DaySeparator.tsx`, `lib/messageDayGroups.ts`)
- [x] Message action menus: received messages get Copy/Reply/Report, sent get Edit/Reply/Copy (`MessageActionMenu.tsx`), each wired to a real action; menu trigger positioning fixed to render after the message bubble, not before (PR #25)
- [x] Duplicate-channel prevention (`idx_chat_requests_one_pending` partial unique index, oracle-denial-preserving) — confirmed already correct on the backend, not rebuilt
- [x] Abusive first-message handling changed from silent-drop to a visible `OffensiveBanner.tsx` in the recipient's requests inbox in place of the decrypted text — sender-side response stays non-distinguishing (oracle-denial preserved); the chat request row is now created (piggybacking on the existing `chat_requests.scan_verdict='abusive'` value) rather than dropped
- [x] Blocked users list under Settings → Privacy (`/settings/privacy`, PR #26)
- [x] Supporting pure-logic modules + tests: `lib/clipboard.ts`, `lib/messageSupersession.ts`, `lib/offensiveContent.ts`, `lib/pendingOutboundRequests.ts`

## Feed Redesign: Horizontal Swipe + Long-Press Thumbnail Picker (2026-09-21 – 2026-09-22) ✅
- [x] Full replacement of vertical swipe-up/down with horizontal swipe/flick — single-card index architecture (`current`/`items`) reused unchanged, only the gesture axis and animation are new (PR #28)
- [x] Tap/swipe/long-press gesture classification extracted to pure, unit-tested `lib/gestureClassifier.ts` (no component-render harness in this repo — matches the `messageDayGroups.ts` precedent)
- [x] Long-press (3s hold) opens `ThumbnailStrip.tsx` — windowed horizontal thumbnail strip (own `VideoThumbnail.tsx` pool, `<video preload="metadata" muted>`, never touching the main player) for jumping directly to any video; selecting one closes the strip
- [x] Live drag-follow: card tracks the pointer 1:1 during drag (zero-transition), then animates a commit-and-exit or snap-back-to-center on release instead of an instant cut (PR #29)
- [x] Velocity-based flick detection: a fast short drag advances even under the 40px distance threshold, tracked live move-to-move rather than at the final move-to-pointerup gap (which undercounts real flicks due to lift latency — found via real-browser timestamp logging, PR #30)
- [x] All gesture/windowing logic verified via Vitest (`gestureClassifier.test.ts`, `feedItems.test.ts`) and real-browser Playwright checks (temporary installs, cleaned up after each PR)

## Houses: Department Browsing + Custom Curated Collections (2026-09-22)

### Schema (U1) ✅
- [x] `houses` table: `id TEXT PK`, `owner_id UUID`, `name`, `description`, `created_at` — custom Houses only; built-in (one per department) have no table, derived from `users.department` at query time
- [x] `house_creator_members` / `house_video_members` junction tables — composite PK, `ON DELETE CASCADE`, mirroring `follows`'s shape; FK typing (`UUID` for creator/owner references) verified correct against a live Postgres instance, not just assumed
- [x] `docs/architecture.md`'s `### Database` block updated with all three tables

### Backend API (U2) ✅
- [x] `GET /houses` — built-in (hardcoded `DEPARTMENTS` list) + custom (with member counts)
- [x] `GET /houses/department/{name}/feed` — built-in House feed, `::uuid`-cast join verified against live Postgres
- [x] `GET /houses/{house_id}/feed` — custom House feed, unioned creator+video membership, dedup confirmed live (one `SELECT`, `OR`'d `WHERE`, no `UNION`/`DISTINCT` needed)
- [x] Both feed routes reuse the exact `_enrich()` transform `GET /feed` already applies (extracted to a shared helper) — confirmed live that every House-feed video has `job_id`/`pillars`/a real presigned `video_url`, not the "No video available" failure mode a skipped enrich step would cause
- [x] `POST /houses` (creator-only) / `DELETE /houses/{house_id}` (owner-only)
- [x] `POST`/`DELETE /houses/{house_id}/members/creators/{creator_id}` and `.../videos/{video_id}` (owner-only)
- [x] `_require_house_owner` — this codebase's first resource-ownership check (404 if missing, 403 if not owner), mirroring `_require_creator`'s shape
- [x] Video-membership has **no** ownership check on the video's creator (KTD2a, deliberate) — confirmed live: an owner can curate a video from a completely unrelated creator into their House
- [x] `POST /auth/upgrade` now validates `department` against the canonical `DEPARTMENTS` list (400 on case-mismatch/whitespace/unknown) — closes the gap where an invalid department silently breaks a creator's own built-in House with no error anywhere
- [x] `frontend/lib/api.ts` typed client functions for every new endpoint
- [x] `tests/test_houses.py` — 36 new live-Postgres integration tests (House CRUD, feed union/dedup, department exact-match, membership idempotency, route-level 403/404/`_enrich()`-reuse); all pass alongside the pre-existing 14 `test_decision_engine.py` tests (50 total)
- [x] `docs/architecture.md` — new `## Houses` section + route documentation + `## Feed Algorithm` divergence note; `README.md`'s API Reference table and Database Schema block updated to match

### Frontend: pure-logic module (U3) ✅
- [x] `frontend/lib/houses.ts` — `parseHouseParam` (the `"department:<name>"` vs. bare-custom-id discriminator behind KTD7) and `formatHouseMemberCount` (singular/plural, zero-half-omitted display formatting)
- [x] `frontend/lib/houses.test.ts` — 9 Vitest tests, all passing

### Frontend: listing page + detail route + nav entry (U4) ✅
- [x] `/houses` (`app/houses/page.tsx`) — Departments + Custom Houses sections from `listHouses()`, tappable cards (department → `/feed?house=department:<name>`, custom → `/houses/[id]`), creator-only "Create a House" inline form posting to the real `createHouse()` client function
- [x] `/houses/[id]` (`app/houses/[id]/page.tsx`) — owner vs. non-owner branch via `getUser()?.id` vs. the House's `owner_id`; non-owner `router.replace`s straight to `/feed?house=<id>` with no intermediate screen (KTD7); owner sees a working "View feed" link plus a Manage Members section
- [x] Manage Members ships as a labeled placeholder/skeleton only in this unit ("Coming soon", no functional search/add/remove) — deliberate scope boundary so U5 can build the real interaction inside the same file without a merge conflict
- [x] One new `nav-bar.tsx` `NAV_ITEMS` entry (`Houses`, `Building2` icon, no `creatorOnly`) — existing active-highlight and badge-dot logic required no changes, confirmed via real-browser check on both `/houses` and `/houses/[id]`
- [x] Verified via `tsc --noEmit` (clean), `eslint` (0 errors), all 171 Vitest tests passing, and real-browser Playwright checks (temporary install, removed after) — 31 assertions covering both sections rendering, card navigation, nav highlighting, the owner/non-owner branch, the placeholder's absence of functional add-member UI, and the create-form POST + redirect flow

### Frontend: House-scoped feed + manage-members UI (U5) ✅
- [x] `frontend/app/feed/page.tsx` — `<Suspense>` restructure: default export is now a thin `<Suspense fallback={null}><FeedPageInner /></Suspense>` shell (exact pattern match to `app/messages/compose/page.tsx`'s existing precedent), today's entire component body moved unchanged into `FeedPageInner`
- [x] Mount effect branches on `useSearchParams().get("house")` via `parseHouseParam` (U3): `null` → existing `getFeed()` path, confirmed byte-for-byte unchanged; department → `getDepartmentHouseFeed()`; custom → `getHouseFeed()` + a parallel `listHouses()` call for the House's name/owner. Single `SectionDivider` (House/department name) instead of Following/Recommended (KTD4)
- [x] `current` resets on House-scope change (covers client-side navigation between two House feeds without a remount)
- [x] Divider-auto-skip (~600ms flash) becoming universal on House-scoped loads confirmed as a known, accepted side effect — verified it resolves cleanly, including for a single-video House
- [x] House-scoped empty state has its own copy (non-owner: "No videos in this House yet."; the custom House's own owner: "No members yet." + a working link to the manage-members view) instead of reusing the default feed's upload-focused copy
- [x] `frontend/app/houses/[id]/page.tsx` — real manage-members UI replaces U4's placeholder: Creators + Videos sections, `settings/privacy`'s confirmed add/remove pattern, debounced global `searchAll()` search for both add flows (video search is NOT self-scoped, per KTD2a), optimistic-after-success add/remove wired to U2's real endpoints
- [x] Member lists are session-local by design (no "list current members" endpoint exists — `GET /houses` returns only counts, `GET /houses/{id}/feed` returns an undifferentiated unioned list) — documented as a real scope boundary, not an oversight
- [x] Verified via `tsc --noEmit` (clean), `eslint` (0 errors), all 171 Vitest tests passing, a clean `next build` (confirms the `<Suspense>` restructure introduces no build/prerender failure), and real-browser Playwright checks (temporary install, removed after) run against a production (`next start`) server — 21/24 assertions pass outright; the remaining 3 are an unrelated, pre-existing console-error signature from `nav-bar.tsx`'s unstubbed realtime-ticket fetch, confirmed present on the plain default-feed scenario too (not a House-scoping regression)
- [x] **Default `/feed` regression guard passed**: no `house` param renders identically to before this unit — correct section label, correct video count, swipe gesture still advances correctly, no uncaught errors, no visible Suspense fallback flash

### Multi-Department Content Tagging ✅ (not yet deployed to EC2)
- [x] New table `video_department_tags` (`video_id, department, is_primary, tagged_at`) — many-to-many, one primary tag (auto-derived from uploader's department at upload time, frozen after) plus up to `MAX_ADDITIONAL_DEPARTMENTS = 5` additional tags
- [x] DB-enforced single-primary-per-video via a partial unique index (`WHERE is_primary`), not just application discipline
- [x] Idempotent backfill in `_ensure_schema()` gives every pre-existing (zero-tag) video a primary tag from its creator's current department — added after this was caught as a real regression by the existing `test_houses.py` suite, not part of the original design
- [x] `get_department_house_feed` rewritten to tag-based membership (`EXISTS` against `video_department_tags`) instead of joining to `users.department` — a video now surfaces in every department it's tagged into, not only its creator's home department
- [x] `POST /videos` accepts an optional `departments` form field (additional tags only — primary is always server-derived, never client-supplied); validates against `DEPARTMENTS` and the max-additional cap
- [x] `POST /videos/{id}/departments` / `DELETE /videos/{id}/departments/{department}` — owner-only, additional tags only; primary tag removal isn't reachable through either route, with a second defense-in-depth layer at the `db.py` level
- [x] `_enrich()` batch-attaches `department_tags` to every feed row (no N+1)
- [x] `frontend/app/upload/page.tsx` — locked primary-department chip + multi-select additional-department picker (primary excluded from its own option list); post-upload result card and status view both render the full tag set
- [x] Found and fixed a real bug via live testing (not code review): FastAPI needs explicit `Form(...)` on a `str` parameter alongside `UploadFile`, or the field silently fails to bind and the intended validation never fires
- [x] `tests/test_department_tags.py` — 26 new tests against a live disposable Postgres; `tests/test_houses.py` updated (fixture + stale local `DEPARTMENTS` list) with no other regressions across its 36 tests
- [ ] Not yet deployed to EC2 / verified live

## Pending / Future
- [ ] Creator profile: list their approved videos inline
- [ ] Notifications for new followers and credits received
- [ ] Saved videos (bookmark persisted to DB, not just local state)
- [ ] CloudFormation UserData fully automated (no manual `pip install` step)
- [ ] Remove `/debug/feed` and `/debug/search` endpoints before public launch
